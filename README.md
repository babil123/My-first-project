# My First Project

This is my very first GitHub project! 🚀  
It’s a simple Python-based project I created to learn how to use Git, GitHub, and version control effectively.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to initialize a Git repository  
- How to stage and commit changes  
- How to push and pull code from GitHub  
- How to handle merge conflicts and rebasing  
- How to organize project files properly

## ⚙️ How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
